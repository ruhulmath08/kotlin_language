# Kotlin Collections

In Kotlin, collections are a group of related objects, similar to a container. They are used to store, manage, and
manipulate groups of data. Kotlin's collection library is extensive and provides a rich set of interfaces and functions
for working with different types of collections.

## Type of Collections
The Kotlin Standard Library provides implementations for basic collection types: sets, lists, and maps. A pair of 
interfaces represent each collection type:

**_A read-only_** interface that provides operations for accessing collection elements.

**_A mutable_** interface that extends the corresponding read-only interface with write 
operations: adding, removing, and updating its elements.

Below is a diagram of the Kotlin collection interfaces:

### 1. [List](#list)

### 2. [Set](#set)

### 3. [Map](#map)

## List

A List is an ordered collection of items, that allows duplicate elements.

## Set

A Set is an unordered collection of unique items, meaning it does not allow duplicate elements.

## Map

A Map is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value.
